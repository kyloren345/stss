                        You probably know about ChatGPT one of the most sophisticated AI language models in the entire
                        world. Basically this means that ChatGPT is practically the only machine of its calibre to
                        exist, so far. However, this is only scratching the surface of ChatGPT's calibre, ChatGPT is
                        also a Machine Learning GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) that uses user input to help
                        itself learn even more, because for example if it says something incorrect, then the user will
                        probably say that what it said was wrong therefore being able to correct itself with somewhat of
                        a saved memory of its mistakes and what it really was. Also ChatGPT uses the entirety of the
                        internet to generate answers for your questions leading to the possibilities that it could be
                        incorrect, this is why there many people at OpenAi that are constantly reducing the parameters
                        for mistakes and increasing the parameters that lead to a correct response. Machine Learning in
                        and of itself is hard to even incorporate into a simple AI machine, the reason for this is
                        because that Machine Learning can take months even years to fully get the true potential out of
                        a machine because its like when you have to learn to do things you've never done before, ChatGPT
                        has been around for over 3 Years and you can tell that those 3 Years were put to possibly
                        forcing ChatGPT to make mistakes so they can remove those parameters while also forcing correct
                        answers to increase the parameters that lead to that.

                            one of the biggest projects that take homes and make them into a gigantic singular hotel

                                <h4>Future of <strong>our</strong> Civilisation and Robots</h4>
                                <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">AI can help use power industries and our future in many
                                    different ways. From helping keep the planet clean to even just reducing the amount
                                    of people working in tough climates or bad workspaces. However, there are somethings
                                    that aren't good, for example jobs that can replace humans with robots which could
                                    put 200-300 million people out of jobs. This will mean that only programming jobs
                                    and other jobs that relate to the creation of robots will exist from that point on
                                    the upside to this though is that then will be an existential amount of effort being
                                    put into making things and designing seeing as robots don't get tired and can work
                                    all day every day, until they require maintenance. AI and robots also have three law
                                    they <strong>have</strong> to follow, These are
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        They can't harm humans.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        They <strong>have</strong> to follow human's orders unless it conflicts with law one.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        They must protect themselves as long as it doesn't disobey the other two laws.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
